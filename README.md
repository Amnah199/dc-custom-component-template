# dc-custom-component-template



### Installation
We use `hatch` to manage our python packages. To install hatch, see the following [link](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install). Once installed, you can create yourself a virtual environment by running the following command:


```bash
hatch shell
```

This will install all necessary packages needed to create a custom component.
You can reference that virtual in your IDE.



### Formatting
We defined a suite of formatting tools. To format your code, run the following command:

```bash
hatch run code-quality:all
```
